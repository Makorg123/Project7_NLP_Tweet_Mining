# Climate Tweet NLP Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Climate Tweet NLP (Natural Language Processing) project. This project is designed to analyze and classify climate-related tweets using various NLP techniques and a Logistic Regression model. It leverages Python libraries such as `NLTK`, `WordCloud`, `TextBlob`, `FreqDist`, `Flatten`, and `CountVectorizer`.

## Introduction
Climate change is a critical issue facing our planet, and social media platforms are a valuable source of public sentiment and discourse on this topic. The Climate Tweet NLP project is designed to analyze climate-related tweets to gain insights into public opinions and emotions surrounding climate change.

**The project involves the following main components:**

- **1) Data Collection:** Gathering climate-related tweets from various sources.
- **2) Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
- **3) Exploratory Data Analysis:** Extracting insights and patterns from the data.
- **4) Feature Extraction:** Creating numerical representations of text data using techniques like CountVectorizer.
- **5) Model Building:** Developing a Logistic Regression model to classify tweets.
- **6)Visualization:** Visualizing the data and model results.

### Dependencies
